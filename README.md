This was a classic game of simon that used background threads to run the animation. 

Daniel Choi created all the images and sounds for this application. Created the threads for the countdown and handled the flashing of each button. Created the score activity to store user scores in a seperate activity.
Charles Fannin created the code to compare user input's with simon's input to check if the player continued or if the game was over.
John Schmitt created the random algorithm and the predefined pattern.
